            EXT. ASHFIELD DISTRICT 7 — ROOFTOP — DAWN<br><br>
            The first image is sky. Not a natural sky — a sky that learned something from a disaster and never forgot it. Deep violet fading into burnt indigo at the horizon. Seven distinct points of impossible light: the Void fractures that ring the Ashfield, their Echo-energy bleeding upward in columns the same color as nothing-good.<br><br>
            The city below: pre-fracture architecture gutted and repopulated with improvised structures. Laundry lines between collapsed towers. Markets in parking structures. A water tower covered in hand-painted district markings. The Ashfield doesn't look like a wasteland. It looks like a place people decided to live in, because the alternative was dying somewhere nicer.

          <div class="script-action">
            A TITLE CARD burns into the sky in clean monospace typography:<br><br>

            Beat. A second card: "THE ASHFIELD NEVER GOT TO VOTE."<br><br>
            The title sequence ignites from this — fracture-crack geometry, ECHO ENERGY threading through the show's title: NULL THRESHOLD. The music is not triumphant. It's the kind of music that understands what it's scoring.

            A world inside a world. The fracture's interior defies the rubble aesthetic of the Ashfield above — inside the Void, geometry has negotiated a truce with Echo energy and arrived at something almost beautiful. Crystal formations the size of cars. Walls that pulse with slow bioluminescent teal. The air is thick with particles of crystallized Echo residue, drifting like underwater snow.<br><br>
            KAIRO VESS moves through this like he works here.<br><br>
            Because he does. He's 19. Patched gear, no corporate insignia, visor cracked and re-sealed three times with the same strip of heavy-duty adhesive that he's going to replace just as soon as — he's never going to replace it. A well-maintained salvage kit on his back. His movements are completely calm: measuring, assessing, occasionally adjusting course by three degrees as if following navigation that only he can see. Because he can.

            SOUND: A deep, rhythmic pulse from deeper in the fracture. Something large. Something territorial. Kairo doesn't look toward the sound — he counts the rhythm, adjusts his route by four degrees, and keeps moving. His avoidance of the entity is so precise it looks choreographed. It was, essentially. He mapped the patrol cycle six months ago and updates the model daily.

            Behind the tape: sixty thousand people who live here. They're watching. Some of them are filming. None of them are being talked to. One of the Meridian corporate Resonants manning the perimeter — AGENCY OFFICER REYES, 30s, badge-lanyard version of a soldier — is having a conversation on a private comm line, turned away from the crowd. The body language of someone who has filed away his discomfort and is waiting for end-of-shift.

            Kairo arrives at the perimeter tape. He studies Void 9C from here. The inversion is visible even at this distance — the fracture's light moves outward in pulses instead of inward. Like a wound breathing wrong.<br><br>

            Kairo finishes his probability calculation. The branches from this moment extend outward in ways he's never seen before — not because they're chaotic, but because they're vast. Because something about this moment has cracked open a future larger than any he's mapped.

The three of them stand in the last light, and the episode closes on something that isn't hope exactly — it's more like the moment before a probability tree opens into something enormous, and you decide to run the calculation anyway.
