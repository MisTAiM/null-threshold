                <div class="line">I mapped the inversion pulse pattern for the first four hours before you arrived. There are eleven entities currently displaced from deeper in the fracture — I can tell you where each of them is and when each one will cross this corridor. The inversion is accelerating, which means you have a window of approximately ninety minutes before the fracture fully inverts and everything inside gets pushed back out at once.</div>

            <div class="caption" style="margin-top:24px;"><strong style="color:#fff;">PANEL A:</strong> Seya and Kairo moving deeper into the inverted fracture together. Her amplification flares against the headwind of Echo energy. He walks just behind her, slightly to the left — the precise spot where her wake creates the lowest-resistance path. He found this position in three steps. She hasn't noticed he found it. Yet.</div>
            <div class="caption" style="margin-top:24px;"><strong style="color:#fff;">PANEL B:</strong> Deep inside the fracture, in a section so saturated with inverted Echo that the light moves like liquid — something crouches on the floor. Small. Still. A person, maybe. Hard to tell from this angle. Hard to tell if they're injured, or sleeping, or completely calm.</div>
            <div class="inner-mono" style="margin-top:32px;">
              KAIRO (V.O.): I've been in a lot of Voids. I have mapped the probability trees of a thousand different environments, a thousand different entities. I have never, not once in three years, encountered a reading I couldn't parse.<br><br>
              KAIRO (V.O.): There is something at the bottom of this fracture.<br><br>
              KAIRO (V.O.): I don't know what it's going to do. I can't see it at all.<br><br>
              KAIRO (V.O.): That should scare me more than it does.
