            <div class="caption" style="margin-top:20px;">Orin holds their mug with both hands and stares into it. Coffee is, apparently, new. They take a careful sip and their expression does something small and genuine — surprised pleasure.

            <div class="caption" style="margin-top:20px;">Seya is looking at the map. Not the network — the individual fractures. The ones over the Ashfield districts. The people the map doesn't show, under every one of those marks.</div>

He's looking at the map — at the network configuration, at the pattern Luca annotated, running it through his probability window. The branches are vast. They branch from here in ways he's never mapped before. But for the first time, they don't dead-end.</div>

              KAIRO (V.O.): I have mapped a thousand fractures. I have never been able to map what comes next. Looking at this room — these three people, this table, these maps — I can see forward further than I ever have. Not because the future is clearer. Because for the first time, there are people in the frame. You can see further when you're not alone in the calculation.<br><br>
              KAIRO (V.O.): Four people the world wrote off. One network someone wants to weaponize. Two hundred thousand lives in the Ashfield that nobody in a Capped City is counting. And whatever is at the center of that network, waiting, which told Orin the door can be opened the right way.<br><br>
              KAIRO (V.O.): I'm still not brave. I'm just very good at math. And the math says we have a window.
